## Examine the Landing section of the portfolio app (first section with blue background).

1. Is it showing a rounded Avatar with a profile picture, a greeting text “Hello, I am Pete!” and a summary bio “A frontend developer specialised in React”?
2. Is the interface clean, with proper vertical separation between the elements, as well as a bigger font size for the bio text?
3. Is the content centred both vertically and horizontally?

## Scroll down to the second section of the application, the Projects section with green background.

1. Does each project card contain an image at the top and a white section underneath for the textual content? Is the card rounded at the edges?
2. Is the card content section showing a vertical stack of 3 text items in the following order: title, description and “See more” accompanied with a right arrow icon?
3. Is the card design clean overall, with proper spacing between elements and different font sizes and strokes? Are there any key warnings in this section when opening the console?

## Verify that the header show/hide functionality is properly implemented

1. The header hides when scrolling down and is visible when scrolling up
2. There is a smooth transition animation happening between the show/hide states
