            garden design and creation, maintenance and landscaping. The company
            also runs a small plant nursery that sells indoor and outdoor
            plants, making them a one-stop shop for clients to
            <i>"transform any space into an oasis you can be proud of."</i>

            Lucky Shrub was started by a husband and wife team, Jason and Maria,
            who share a long-time love for plants. Jason is the garden
            architect. He creates and oversees all designs while managing his
            team of landscapers. Maria manages all the marketing for the company
            and oversees the nursery.
