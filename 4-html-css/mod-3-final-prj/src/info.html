            garden design and creation, maintenance and landscaping. The company
            also runs a small plant nursery that sells indoor and outdoor
            plants, making them a one-stop shop for clients to

            architect. He creates and oversees all designs while managing his
            team of landscapers. Maria manages all the marketing for the company
            and oversees the nursery.
