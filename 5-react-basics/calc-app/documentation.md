## Set up

```sh
npm create vite@latest calc-app -- --template react
cd calcul-app
npm install
npm fund
```

## Grading

When interacting with the calculator app in the UGL or VS Code:

1.Did each button have a function?
2. Did each button contain the required mathematical operator?
3. Did each calculation provide the correct result as its output?
4. Can you suggest any improvements for the calculator app?
5. You'll also need to give feedback on and grade the assignments of two other learners using the same criteria.

### Example of the calculator app.

### How to create

Your calculator has to be a React app. You can develop this app in any lab environment that you have used earlier in this course. Alternatively, you can use VS Code on your local machine.

To submit your project you need to download your files to your local machine by right-clicking on them in the Explorer panel and selecting "Download".

You will be required to submit your React app by uploading a zipped project folder that contains your app's code.

> [!attention] Note
> Before uploading your solution, make sure to delete the node_modules folder from your project. This will save about 500Mb on the upload which will ensure that you can upload the file.

### How to review

Once you have submitted your app, you are required to review two peer submissions. You need to download their zipped project folders, unzip them and open them in VS Code.

1. When you open a peer's project inside the terminal
1. Open folder that contains the `package.json` file
1. run `npm install`
1. run `npm start`
