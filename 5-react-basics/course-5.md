# Course 5: React Basics

# Mod 1. React Components

Every website's UI is built on a foundation of components and composability. Simple components combined into more complex ones, which eventually merge to form a website.

A website can essentially be viewed as a highly complex components.

There's a part of the reason why React is so popular, is because it streamlines the process of building and composing components. React does this efficiently and without a significant impact on your browser's resources.

State is simply all the values of all the variables your app is working with at any given point in time.

## 1.1 Course Intro

## 1.1.1 How is React used in the real world?

There are plenty of React based apps that you've probably used before. Facebook and Instagram are two examples. But Netflix, Airbnb, New York Times, and a variety of other companies also use React for their websites as well, so you've likely encountered it before.

Facebook.com had become really not performing and not modern looking after the 10 or so years that we have been using it, we had squeezed all of the performance wins that we could out of Facebook.com. Really the only option at that point was to rewrite it on a different stack that was going to be a lot faster and a lot easier to build on. Basically, there was a need for having a really fast and responsive UI and React fills all of those needs.

React is open sourced, meaning that anyone can contribute to it, and those engineers are working full-time on React. But we also have developers who aren't at Meta who are also contributing to React, and that means that there's a really strong community around React.
