## full sites

1. **Teletext**:
2. **Spofix**: A stream platform for music and movies
3. **doors**: A fake OS, like [Windows 93](http://v1.windows93.net)
4. **term** on the web

## spare ideas

1. Based on [Ors1mer](https://ors1mer.xyz/) i can make an meta term emulator. so ppl can find by tapping term commands on the site.
